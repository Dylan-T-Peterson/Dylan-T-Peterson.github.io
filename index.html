                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>My name is Dylan Tyler Peterson, and I'm an Alaskan Native data analyst based in Anchorage, Alaska.
                    My hobbies include crocheting, archery, lock picking, coding, hacking/pen testing, and programming.
                    I'm a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) enthusiast, with my main workstation running an Ubuntu
                    distro of Linux (I aspire to overhaul to Gentoo eventually for performance and modular control
                    reasons). I trained and am certified in data analytics through Thinkful.</p>

                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>My current work setup is an Asus ROG Strix laptop with an AMD Ryzen 9 5980HX CPU and an AMD Radeon RX
                    6800M GPU. I run Ubuntu as my primary work operating system. However, I run Windows on a secondary
                    NVME SSD, mainly for gaming purposes and to familiarize myself with the OS and PowerShell. For my
                    software setup on Ubuntu, I've replaced the standard GNOME Display Manager with I3WM, as tiled
                    window managers are more intuitive and more streamlined to work with for me. I run most of my
                    interactions through the command line.</p>

                <h3>Sears, Roebuck and Co. ~ Merchandising Lead</h3>
                <h4>March 2017 - April 2018</h4>
                <p>I worked as a hardlines merchandising lead for Sears, Roebuck, and Co. During my time there, I was in
                    charge of optimizing product placement in correlation with related products to enhance customer
                    experience while increasing product-customer engagement. I also validated product pricing to verify
                    that it was current and congruent with the internal pricing model from Sears Corporate. While my
                    position was mainly front-end, I assisted with back-end operations, including inventory auditing and
                    product intake, during my slow times and as the back-end team needed help.</p>

                <h3>Lowe's Home Centers, LLC ~ Delivery Assistant</h3>
                <h4>February 2019 - June 2020</h4>
                <p>I initially applied for the customer service associate position in the lumber department. I chose
                    that position to familiarize myself with the construction industry and the tools/equipment used.
                    During my time in that position, I was in charge of restocking and maintaining the department, which
                    included using heavy machinery (mainly a propane-based forklift). I used my previous experience with
                    price validation along with legacy software to verify and fix pricing errors and outdated values.
                    After approximately three months working there, I transferred to the delivery department as a
                    full-time delivery assistant. In this new position, I helped coordinate next-day deliveries and
                    ensured timely, accurate, and intact deliveries. Most of the deliveries were appliances; however, I
                    also assisted in transporting bulk construction materials by aiding the CDL drivers. When supporting
                    the CDL driver, I kept watch for unsuspected vehicles and ensured safe transit of goods while he was
                    operating the truck-mounted forklift.</p>

                <h3>United Brotherhood of Carpenters ~ Apprentice Carpenter</h3>
                <h4>February 2020 - July 2021</h4>
                <p>Being a carpenter had been a longtime dream of mine since the start of middle school, and that only
                    grew when I was in Applied tech. To achieve my goal of joining the union, I expedited my graduation
                    from the CyberLynx program in a matter of months. I worked hard to earn my driver's license in
                    December 2019. In this position, I learned much about the construction industry and the inner
                    workings of being a carpenter. As an apprentice, I increased my understanding of architectural
                    mathematics and refined my work ethic. This era of my career allowed me to understand the dedication
                    it took to see through long-term projects and also honed my capabilities with time, money, and
                    stress management.</p>

                <h3>Mirage Auto Painting & Collision ~ Data Analyst</h3>
                <h4>July 2021 - April 2022</h4>
                <p>I left the construction industry due to the inability to have a comfortable balance between work and
                    personal life, as the weeks away from my family created a strain that was not worth the money I was
                    earning. I allowed myself a week's break to relieve the stresses of being away from home for weeks
                    and get my head back on straight, and then I started to apply locally. I wanted something to foster
                    my love for technology and shift my career into data analytics. During my time in this position, I
                    created low-cost automatic report frameworks through applications such as Excel and rudimentary
                    formatting and report creation using the Pandas module. We switched to BIRT shortly before I
                    departed from the business. With these customized report generation applications, I created tailored
                    graphs and visualizations, using Excel's pivot tables to create ad hoc graphs, then used Python's
                    Seaborn pandas to create more prepared plots for informative presentations choreographed in
                    PowerPoint.</p>

                <h3>Lowe's Home Centers, LLC ~ Appliance Sales Specialist</h3>
                <h4>April 2022 - May 2023</h4>
                <p>I parted ways with Mirage due to increasing hostility from the owner/operator and learning about
                    internal actions I disagreed with. After parting ways, I found a new position available at Lowe's.
                    With my newfound experience and a proven previous work ethic, I applied to and became a sales
                    specialist in the appliance department. As a sales associate, I was a good source of information for
                    our customer base and acted as the main point of contact for our customers' shopping experience.
                    While in this position, I increased my knowledge of consumer electronics and wanted luxuries. I
                    could bring my previous analyst experience to explain current sales trends in an understandable way
                    to my lead and superiors. I harnessed our internal sales data through their sales application using
                    manual data entry into Excel to graph sales trends as our financial quarters closed. I worked
                    closely with my assistant store manager to inform him of the current sales trends and help project
                    what appliances we should request from our appliance distribution center and regional distribution
                    center. In this position, I was crucial in interacting with high-value customers and corporations
                    while managing multiple high-dollar projects and orders. I excelled in interpersonal de-escalation
                    and conflict resolution, and I could find quick and efficient solutions with my deep understanding
                    of the proprietary inventory management system.</p>

                <h3>ESS Worldwide ~ Sanitization QAQC/Lead</h3>
                <h4>June 2023 - Current</h4>
                <p>I left Lowe's due to disagreements with changes made in the departmental structure and the expected
                    decrease in available specialists. I took a month off to unwind with my wife and help her with
                    Spring cleaning. After allowing myself to recuperate, I landed a temporary job as a sanitation
                    worker through a contractor for the Alaska Railroad Corporation. During this position, my initial
                    tasks were to help clean, sanitize, and restock the train lines that run during the summer season.
                    Excelling at the job involved a keen eye for detail to ensure that we thoroughly and adequately
                    sanitized with the proper chemicals. This adherence to quality eventually landed me a position as a
                    lead, where my main focus was quality assurance and quality control. Through the summer, I gained
                    enough interest from my supervisor and department manager to be offered a full-time position at the
                    company under the same occupational title of lead/QAQC. I continue to work with ESS and go above and
                    beyond to ensure my work is excellent.</p>

                <p>Q: Why are all of your SQL queries written with SQLite3 syntax?<br>A: I currently don't have the
                    necessary infrastructure to obtain or maintain an actual server database, so instead of leaving out
                    SQL as a whole, I decided to use the resources I currently have to practice and strengthen my SQL
                    literacy.</p>

                <p>Q: What is your development setup?<br>A: My main workstation is a Ubuntu-based setup running I3WM for
                    my window manager. I've heavily customized a fork of Neovim, mainly for Python, SQL, and front-end
                    web development. I modify my configuration files to improve productivity and ease of use when
                    encountering things I could optimize during my projects.</p>

                <p>Q: What professional experience do you have in data analytics?<br>A: I have a year of
                    professional experience and another year of freelance experience. I keep my skills growing
                    with my projects and continue to expand my understanding of analytical techniques and more efficient
                    methods by staying informed and up to date-with new program/language releases.</p>

                <p>Q: What experience do you have with analytic programs?<br>A: I have experience in Excel, Tableau, and
                    creating custom Python scripts. My knowledge of Excel includes using HLOOKUP/VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH,
                    and pivot charts/tables. In Tableau, I can create cohesive and insightful dashboards and stories. My
                    most extensive area of expertise is manipulating and analyzing data through customized Python
                    scripts and personalized SQL queries, including manipulating DataFrames through the Pandas module or
                    database modification and querying through the SQLite3 module. I am proficient in creating data
                    visualizations using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn modules.</p>

                <p>Q: What are your experiences with software development life cycle frameworks and processes?<br>A: I
                    currently do not work on large enough projects or teams to necessitate an SDLC, so I need to gain
                    experience with any SDLC framework. I have informed myself about various SDLC frameworks, including
                    Scrum Agile, Waterfall, Lean, Iterative, and Spiral.</p>
