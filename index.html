                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>My name is Dylan Tyler Peterson, and I'm a born and raised Alaskan Native. Some of my hobbies are crocheting, archery, lock picking, coding, and hacking/pentesting, and programming. I'm a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) enthusiast, with my main workstation being an Ubuntu distro of Linux (I aspire to eventually overhaul to Gentoo for performance and modular control reasons). I am professionally trained in data analytics from Thinkful</p>

                <h3>Sears, Roebuck and Co. ~ Merchandising Lead</h3>
                <h4>March 2017 - April 2018</h4>
                <p>I worked as a hardlines merchandising lead for Sears, Roebuck and Co. During my time there, I was in charge of optimizing product placement in correlation with related product to enhance customer experience while increasing product-customer engagement. I also validated product pricing to verify that it was current and congruent with the internal pricing model from Sears corporate. While my position was mainly front end, I assisted with back end operations including inventory auditing and product intake during my slow times and as the back end team needed help.</p>
                
                <h3>Lowe's Home Centers, LLC ~ Delivery Assistant</h3>
                <h4>February 2019 - June 2020</h4>
                <p>Initially, I was on boarded as a customer service associate for the lumber department. I chose that position to get more accustomed and acquainted with the construction industry and with the tools/equipment used. Through my time in that position, I was in charge of restocking and maintaining the department which included the use of heavy machinery (mainly a propane-based forklift). I was able to use my previous experience with price validation along with legacy software to verify and fix pricing errors and outdated values. After approximately three months of working there, I was moved to the delivery department as a full-time delivery assistant. In this new position, I helped coordinate next-day deliveries and assisted in ensuring timely, accurate, and intact deliveries. The majority of the deliveries were appliances, however I also assisted in the transportation of bulk construction materials by aiding the CDL drivers. When supporting the CDL driver, I kept watch for unsuspected vehicles and ensured safe transit of goods while he was operating the truck-mounted forklift.</p>

                <h3>United Brotherhood of Carpenters ~ Apprentice Carpenter</h3>
                <h4>February 2020 - July 2021</h4>
                <p>Being a carpenter was a longtime dream of mine since the start of middle school, that truly grew when I was in Applied tech. To achieve my goal of joining the union, I expedited my graduation from the CyberLynx program in a matter of months, and worked hard to earn my drivers license during the month of December 2019. In this position I learned a lot about the construction industry and the inner workings of being a carpenter. During my time as an apprentice I was able to increase my understanding of architectural mathematics and refine my work ethic. This era of my career was allowed me to understand the dedication it took to see through long-term projects and also honed my capabilities with time, money, and stress management.</p>
          
                <h3>Mirage Auto Painting & Collision ~ Data Analyst</h3>
                <h4>July 2021 - April 2022</h4>
                <p>I left the construction industry due to the inability to have a comfortable balance between work and personal life as the weeks away from my family created strain not worth the money I was earning. I allowed myself a week break to relieve the stresses of being away from home for weeks on end and to get my head back on straight, then started to apply around locally. I wanted something that would be able to foster my love for technology and shift my career into data analytics. My time at this position was mainly creating low cost automatic report frameworks through applications such as Excel and rudimentary formatting and report creation using the Pandas module. With these customized report generation applications I was able to create tailored graphs and visualizations, using Excel's pivot tables create ad hoc graphs, then used Python's Seaborn pandas to creating more prepared plots for informative presentations choreographed in PowerPoint.</p>
                
                <h3>Lowe's Home Centers, LLC ~ Appliance Sales Specialist</h3>
                <h4>April 2022 - May 2023</h4>
                <p>I parted ways with Mirage due to increasing hostility from the owner/operator and learning about internal actions that I disagreed with. After parting ways, I was able to find a new position available at Lowe's, and with my new found experience and a proven previous work ethic, I applied to and got a sales specialist in the appliance department. As a sales associate I was tasked with being a good source of information to our customer base, and acting as the main point of contact for our customer's shopping experience. While in this position I was able to increase my knowledge in consumer electronics, wanted luxuries, and I was even able to bring my previous analyst experience in to explain current sales trends in an understandable way to my lead and superiors. I was able to harness our internal sales data through their sales application using manual data entry into Excel to graph sales trends as our financial quarters closed. I worked closely with my assistant store manager to inform him on the current sales trends and help project what appliances we should be requesting from our appliance distribution center and regional distribution center.While at this position, I played as a key interaction point between high value customers and corporations while managing multiple high dollar projects and orders. I excelled in interpersonal de-escalation and conflict resolution, capable of finding quick and efficient solutions with my deep understanding of the proprietary inventory management system.</p>

                <h3>ESS Worldwide ~ Sanitization QAQC/Lead</h3>
                <h4>June 2023 - Current</h4>
                <p>I left Lowe's due to disagreements with changes made in the departmental structure and expected decrease in available specialists. I was able to take a month off to touch base with my wife and help her with autumn cleaning</p>

                <p>Q: Why are all of your SQL queries written with SQLite3 syntax?<br>A: I currently don't have the necessary infrastructure to obtain or maintain an actual server database so instead of leaving out SQL as a whole I decided to use the resources I currently have to practice and maintain my SQL literacy.
                <p>Q: What is your development setup?<br>A: My main workstation is an Ubuntu based setup running I3WM for my window manager and a fork of Neovim that I've heavily customized mainly for Python, SQL, and front-end web development. I tend to modify my configuration files as needed to improve productivity and ease of use when I come across things I could optimize during my projects.</p>
                <p>Q: What professional experience do you have in data analytics?<br>A: I currently have a year of professional experience with about another year of freelance experience. I keep my skills growing with my projects and continue to expand my understanding of analytical techniques/more efficient methods by keeping myself informed and up to date with new program/language releases.</p>
                <p>Q: What experience do you have with analytic programs?<br>A: I have experience in Excel, Tableau, and creating custom scripts using Python. My knowledge of Excel includes use of HLOOKUP/VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and pivot charts/tables. In Tableau I am able to create cohesive and insightful dashboards and stories. My largest area of expertise comes to the manipulation and analysis of data through customized python scripts and personalized SQL queries, including the manipulation of DataFrames through the Pandas module, or database modification and querying through the SQLite3 module. I also have proficiency in the creation of data visualizations using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn modules.</p>
                <p>Q: What experience do you have with different software development life cycle frameworks and processes?<br>A: Due to my lack of team based software development I do not currently have hands-on experience with any SDLC frameworks. However, I have kept myself informed about a variety of SDLC frameworks including the Scrum Agile framework, Waterfall, Lean, Iterative, and Spiral.</p>
